            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>My name is Ryan Pate, im 19 and I am excited to soon start my further education, hopefully, at NUA. I already attend the Colchester Institute College
            where I am currently studying Computing full time where I will be completing my course in June. I am predicted and hoping for a D* D* D at the end of my course.</p>
            <h3>Why I Want to Study Here</h3>
            <p>I have always known I wanted to have a career in Game Development and thought that the best way to achieve this would be to obtain a degree.
            What made me know NUA was the University for me was how the atmosphere screamed creativity through its different courses, any kind of prospectus I read,
                the people who I have met who have attended NUA or the physical University itself. Seeing this made me very eager and set on wanting a place here.</p>
            <h3>My Future Goals and Plans</h3>
            <p>One of my main goals is to get a Masters in Game Development, which I then plan to use to start my career in the game development industry. </p>
