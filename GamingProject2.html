				<h1>Space Shooter<br />
					Game</h1>
				<p>A side scrolling shooter I created in Unity by following a guide online.<br />
					It has been built to work on HTML5 and embedded on the website so you can give it a try.<br />
					This can be found on the bottom of the page</p>

			<p>This is another game I decided to make in my own time using Unity. I got inspiration to make this from a friend who also made something similar for his college coursework using Game Maker Studio.
			I decided id like to try and make something similar but by instead using Unity. I used a couple tutorials to get to grips on how to create a side scroller and then started when I was confident I knew what I was doing.
			Most of the assets used in the making this game were either found online, given to my by the same friend or again made by one of my other friends Alex.</p>
			<p>The controls for the Space Shooter are pretty simple, just use the WASD for movement and also K to fire your weapon. Dodge the Asteroids and incoming fire from enemies and try to see how long you can go on for.</p>
			<p>You can test the game for yourself by clicking the button below.</p>
