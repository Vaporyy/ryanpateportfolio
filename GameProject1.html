				<h1>Falling Game</h1>
				<p>This is a simple game I made in Unity after following a couple tutorials. <br />
				It's made for Mobile devices (hence the scene size) but also works on the web <br />
				as seen embedded here (at the bottom of the page).</p>

				<p>This is a game I made in my own time using Unity. Most of the assets were sourced online but some of them (including the square character you play as) was made by one of my friends.
					I followed a couple of guides online and decided I wanted to create a simple mobile game, which is a platform I haven't made a game for, to challenge myself and see what I could come
					up with. <br /> <br />
					I started by coming up with a general idea which was to have a character, that the user would control, needing to keep falling down, landing on the platforms and dodging obstacles. The assets, as previously stated,
					were mostly found online with a few of them made by my friend Alex (who already attends NUA).
					The main goal of the game is to maneuver the Square character on the platforms, as they are rising to constantly, to fall down so you dont hit the spikes at the top. Their are different obstacles like enemies, sliding platforms
					and platforms that break if you stand on the too long that you have to avoid on your way down. This made the game a little more interesting to play and create. The goal is to collect the gold star.
					There is definitely more I would like to add, especially a jump mechanic so it is easier to maneuver the character.<br /><br />
					You can test the game for yourself by clicking the button below.</p>
